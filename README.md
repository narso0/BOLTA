## 📋 Prerequisites

- **Node.js** 18.0.0 or higher
- **npm** 8.0.0 or higher
- **Expo CLI** (`npm install -g @expo/cli`)
- **iOS Simulator** (for iOS development)
- **Android Studio** (for Android development)

## 🚀 Getting Started

### 1. Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/narso0/BOLTA.git
cd BOLTA/BoltaMobile
```

### 2. Install Dependencies

```bash
npm install
```

### 3. Start Development Server

```bash
npm start
# or
expo start
```

### 4. Run on Device/Simulator

- **iOS**: Press `i` in terminal or scan QR code with Camera app
- **Android**: Press `a` in terminal or scan QR code with Expo Go app
- **Web**: Press `w` in terminal (for testing only)

## 📱 Running on Physical Device

### iOS
1. Install **Expo Go** from App Store
2. Scan QR code from terminal with Camera app
3. App will open in Expo Go

### Android
1. Install **Expo Go** from Google Play Store
2. Scan QR code from terminal with Expo Go app
3. App will run directly

## 🔧 Development Scripts

```bash
# Start development server
npm start

# Start with cleared cache
npm start -- --clear

# Run on iOS simulator
npm run ios

# Run on Android emulator
npm run android

# Run on web (for testing)
npm run web

# Build for production
expo build:android
expo build:ios
```

## 🏗 Building for Production

### Android APK
```bash
expo build:android -t apk
```

### iOS App Store
```bash
expo build:ios -t archive
```

### Using EAS Build (Recommended)
```bash
# Install EAS CLI
npm install -g eas-cli

# Configure build
eas build:configure

# Build for Android
eas build --platform android

# Build for iOS
eas build --platform ios
```

## 🔒 Permissions

The app requires the following permissions:

### Android
- `ACTIVITY_RECOGNITION` - For step tracking
- `ACCESS_FINE_LOCATION` - For improved accuracy (optional)
- `ACCESS_COARSE_LOCATION` - For location-based features (optional)

### iOS
- **Motion & Fitness** - For step tracking
- **Location** - For improved accuracy (optional)

## 🎯 Key Features Implementation

### Step Tracking Algorithm
- Uses device accelerometer data
- Implements peak detection for step counting
- Filters out false positives with threshold values
- Calculates distance and calories automatically

### Data Management
- Automatic daily reset at midnight
- Persistent storage with AsyncStorage
- Real-time updates and synchronization
- Error handling and recovery

### User Experience

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **Metro bundler issues**
   ```bash
   npx react-native start --reset-cache
   ```

2. **iOS simulator not working**
   ```bash
   npx react-native run-ios --simulator="iPhone 14"
   ```

3. **Android build issues**
   ```bash
   cd android && ./gradlew clean && cd ..
   npx react-native run-android
   ```

4. **Expo Go connection issues**
   - Ensure device and computer are on same network
   - Try restarting Expo development server
   - Clear Expo Go app cache

### Performance Optimization
- Step detection runs at 10Hz for optimal battery usage
- Automatic cleanup of sensor listeners
- Efficient state management to prevent re-renders
- Lazy loading of non-essential components

## 🔄 Syncing with Web App
